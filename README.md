Anime Music Video

This is the source code behind Anime Music Video.

The idea of this service is inspired from rawgit.com (formerly rawgithub.com). I just realized that using a whole framework (node.js with express.js) for such simple thing as requests proxying is overkilling, and made same stuff using nginx only.

This is also a game: I am trying to implement the same functionality using nginx config files only. No programming languages allowed. Come join me!
